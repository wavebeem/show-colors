# show-colors

Shows an ANSI color table in your terminal! I'm not sure why, but I couldn't
find a suitable package that did this already. It seems like people are just
copying random Perl and Bash scripts from the internet to do this job.

## Use instantly with npx

```bash
$ npx show-colors
```

## Install with npm

```bash
$ npm install -g show-colors
$ show-colors
```

## Short mode

The options `-s` or `--short` can be used to get a smaller version of the table
without text.
